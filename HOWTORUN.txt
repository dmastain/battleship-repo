To run the game simply run the GampeApp java class which contains a main method, 
the program will prompt you for two player names and then begin placing ships
for each of them. After ships are placed the game will enter the firing stage 
and continue until all 5 of one player's ships have been sunk.

	Suggestions:
		-- While the program does it's best to bounds check prompts it is suggested 
		   you conform to the style requested.
		   
To run tests, make sure JUnit 5 is a part of the build path and use the built in
Eclipse test runner.
